First make sure you have setup Yarn and React Native development environment locally: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Then follow step by step instructions:

1. `yarn` in mobile folder
2. `pod install` in ios folder
3. `yarn ios` in mobile folder again
4. `yarn ios12` in mobile folder (starts another simulator to test collaborative editing)
